          <h4>Course Format</h4>
          <p>
            The content of this course is centered on a three-part process of
            building self-advocacy:
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>1. Understanding one's needs</p>
            <p>2. Knowing what supports might help</p>
            <p>3. Communicating those needs with others</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            While you learn more about each part of the process, you'll have the
            opportunity to explore strategies to implement and practice. You'll
            also be invited to reflect on a current challenge to consider how
            the process of self-advocacy can help you determine what you need to
            move forward.
